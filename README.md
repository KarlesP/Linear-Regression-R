# Linear-Regression-R
• This is an R script which asks the user for some paths and then compiles an html report using linear regression
• Using the script named "User's Inputs" you can just edit it based on your problem and your data. Just open RStudio or R or even notepad and run the code. Note:In case you want to do a complete Quantitative Analysis you need more than just a Linear Regression.
